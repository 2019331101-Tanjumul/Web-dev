       the chart was coming down and then i have to put it close back with the use of the cross logo right ? 
       i previously defined the .showModal which is used to represent it with only top of 50%; 
       but as you can see there is a top of -500 in the modal which is currently sitting outside of the screen now. that's why i previously added  to 
       a button with the show option , now  here is the thing : i will make it back to the previous stated before i pressed the button now , 
       doing .. the  modal.classList.remove option i just passed the showModal , here it's working like ::: it's going back to the previous states with 
       the click of the span which is cross .
