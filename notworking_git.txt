Problem : 

it error: failed to push some refs to remote hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

Fix : 

git fetch origin main:tmp 
git rebase tmp 
git push origin HEAD:tmp 
git branch -D tmp 
git push 

#now it will work fine like before !
